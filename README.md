# Comparative-Study-of-Image-Encryption-Algorithms-Using-Data-Analysis

**Technologies used:**
Python

An application which provides secure transmission of images and comparative
analysis of the data generated from various image encryption algorithms. Image
encryption is a procedure which converts plain image to an encrypted image by
employing a secret key. Different algorithms can be used to produce image
encryption. In this project, a comparative study of the algorithms like DES, Triple
DES, AES, RSA, and IDEA are made. Almost all digital services like internet
communication, medical and military imaging systems, multimedia system needs a
high-level security. There is a need for security level in order to safely store and
transmit digital images containing critical information. Therefore, there is a need
for image encryption techniques in order to hide images from various attacks. The
data generated by above encryption algorithms are gathered and perform analysis
and visualize the data using python. A descriptive model analysis is performed on
the data considering the key factors like year, block size, rounds, confidentiality,
authentication etc. As a result, this project assists users in differentiating between
secure algorithms and selecting the appropriate algorithm for their needs.
